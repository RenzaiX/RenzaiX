### Hey there! 👋 I'm Nick.

I'm a computer science enthusiast at UIC, set to graduate in 2025 with a solid 3.8 GPA. 🎓📈 But it's not all about the numbers for me. What really excites me is the thrill of creating something from nothing—whether that's crafting sleek software or performing elegant data analysis. 🚀

My tech journey kicked off at Viktoriia TMM as a Systems Analyst Intern, where I didn't just squash bugs—I reengineered customer service processes, cutting support tickets by 30%. 🛠️💡 Fewer headaches all around! Plus, I sped up response times by introducing an efficient customer inquiry system. It's all about making experiences smoother and faster!

I've also explored content creation, doubling viewership on YouTube by delivering exactly what the audience wants. 📹🌟 At Valmatic, I turned raw footage into compelling stories, always on time and within budget.

Looking ahead, I'm pumped to dive into an internship focused on software engineering or data analysis. I'm all about soaking up knowledge and applying my skills in SQL, Python, R, and more. 🌐🔧

I'm aiming to make a meaningful impact in a place that values innovation, teamwork, and a sprinkle of geeky enthusiasm. 🌟 If you're looking for someone who's passionate about both the code and the story behind it, let's connect! Who knows what problems we could solve together? 🤝🧠

Let’s make something awesome together. 🌟
